This webpage was created from the [pwills.com][4], hosted on GitHub Pages. Functions as an online
resume/portfolio and offers me a chance to tell you about my experience and interests ;-).

To build the site locally, do

	git clone https://github.com/peterewills/peterewills.github.io.git
	cd peterewills.github.io
    gem install bundler # to get the dependency manager that jekyll uses
	bundle update # to make sure all ruby gems are up to date
	bundle exec jekyll serve
	
Then navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to view the page.

For a more detailed guide on how the site was built, check out [the how-to post
on the blog][5]

Site is built in jekyll on top of [Minimal Mistakes][1]. Uses images from
[Unsplash][2]. If you have questions, drop me a line at [akmal@namal.edu.pk](mailto:akmal@namal.edu.pk).
