This post continues my series on data science interviews. One of the major difficulty of
doing data science interviews is that you must show expertise in a wide variety of
skills. In particular, I see four key subject areas that you might be asked about during
an interview: 

1. Statistics
2. Software Engineering/Coding
3. Machine Learning
4. "Soft" Questions
