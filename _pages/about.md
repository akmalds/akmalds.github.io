# About Me

I help organizations understand and leverage their quantitative
information. Call it what you will: data science, machine learning, or
statistics; the modern technological world lies at the intersection of
mathematics and computing, and that's where I like to play.

I've worked with [Stage 1 start-ups][5] and [publicly traded corporations][6],
building models, establishing codebases, and providing mathematical expertise to
developers. My mother tongue is Python, but I also speak Scala and Java. I have
experience working with Apache Spark, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, pandas, and many
other popular data analysis and machine learning libraries.

I have a bachelors degree in Physics from Reed College, where I did
[my thesis][2] on measurement of quantum entanglement in optical systems. After
spending some time pursuing other interests,[^fnote2] I began working on my
Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado. My dissertation covers a
range of topics in statistics, data analytics, and understanding noisy
systems. For more details on all that, check out [my portfolio](/portfolio/), or
take a look at [my resume][4]. 

I currently live in San Francisco, where I work as a data scientist with the
inventory optimization team at [Stitch Fix][7].

[^fnote2]: After graduating from Reed, I spent some time living at
	[Great Vow Zen Monastery][3], where we followed a daily schedule of work and
	meditation.
